# TO DO
* decouple stroke collection from rendering
* read confirmed force force
  * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/pencil_interactions/handling_input_from_apple_pencil
* get perpendicular force https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/pencil_interactions/handling_input_from_apple_pencil/computing_the_perpendicular_force_of_apple_pencil
* Also this: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/touches_presses_and_gestures/leveraging_touch_input_for_drawing_apps
* Draw circles to represent UI elements
* detect hit targets to trigger UI elements
* predict touches and replay actual touches after the fact
* pick colors from UI
* pause play back when not replay or not drawing
* 

# DONE
* pause rendering after idle timeout
* capture and replay
* render strokes with instanced draw
* record, replay, clear

This is a story about and outpost.

The setting is in outer space. An artificial gravity well circles around a moon sized moon of a gas giant, 6AU from its parent star where its orbit passes through a colliding nebula. The outpost is one of a dozen in quazi-steady state orbits that takes them around a dozen moons, in an intra-planetary highway. The outpost, CA-459, is currently passing by, very slowly, a lifeless moon of volcanic ice. The pressure of the moon forces dozen kilometer high eruptions of methane ice, spraying back in cascading rainbows.

The stars are enveloped in a cool cerulean blue swirl of star dust. 

The story is of a girl stationed by her self on this outpost. A steel can with the volume of a short bus attached to skyscraper-shaped weapon that has enough firepower to end a civilization. Her job was ostensibly to monitor for in-coming bogeys at near-c and blast them to smithereans. Her job title was  weapons specialist and her role was advanced defense officer. Her parents were proud of her serving to protect their homeworld. Her friends were jealous of her achievements and benefits. Her commander had told her she was assigned the job as punishment for insubordination for reporting on him. Six months spent in solitude to think about her actions was how he wanted her to spend her time. 

She would have refused if her mom did not need the medical benefits that came with the job. Now she is on the fourth month of voluntary confinement and things back home are going to hell. She got a note from her dad how the government is shutting down non-essential services to conserve energy. Apparently someone or something has destabilized most of the electrical grid. Rumors about an impending invasion is so thick in the air you can choke on it.

What is the plot? She meets an AI, falls in love, and realizes it is a ploy from the enemy to launch an attack?
She hallucinates, mistakenly think the enemy is attacking and ends up firing at the moon?
She grows crazy thinking about how her parents are suffering?
