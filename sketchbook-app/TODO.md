# TO DO
* decouple stroke collection from rendering
* read confirmed force force
  * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/pencil_interactions/handling_input_from_apple_pencil
* get perpendicular force https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/pencil_interactions/handling_input_from_apple_pencil/computing_the_perpendicular_force_of_apple_pencil
* Also this: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/touches_presses_and_gestures/leveraging_touch_input_for_drawing_apps
* pick colors from UI
* pause play back when not replay or not drawing

# DOING
* change brush size with UI
    - can only increase size, not decrease...
    - need to disable drawing when changing size
    - debug why largest brush ui is not cleared

# DONE
* pause rendering after idle timeout
* Draw circles to represent UI elements
* capture and replay
* render strokes with instanced draw
* record, replay, clear
* detect hit targets to trigger UI elements
* predict touches and replay actual touches after the fact
*
